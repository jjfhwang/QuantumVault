# QuantumVault: Secure and Quantum-Resistant Key Management

QuantumVault is a secure and robust key management system designed with quantum-resistance in mind. It leverages advanced cryptographic techniques and a Rust-based implementation to provide a highly secure solution for storing, managing, and accessing sensitive cryptographic keys. This project aims to provide a trustworthy and future-proof key management solution for applications requiring the highest levels of security.

The project's core purpose is to address the growing threat posed by quantum computing to traditional cryptographic algorithms. QuantumVault implements post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms alongside traditional ciphers, allowing for a seamless transition to a quantum-resistant future. By offering a flexible and adaptable key management system, QuantumVault enables developers to protect their data and systems against both classical and quantum attacks. The Rust implementation ensures memory safety, high performance, and cross-platform compatibility, making it a reliable choice for critical infrastructure and security-sensitive applications.

QuantumVault offers a range of features including secure key generation, storage, rotation, and access control. It provides a well-defined API for integrating key management functionalities into existing applications. The system is designed with a modular architecture that allows for the easy addition of new cryptographic algorithms and security features. Regular security audits and rigorous testing are planned to ensure the ongoing integrity and robustness of the system. QuantumVault strives to be a leading solution in quantum-resistant key management, providing peace of mind in an evolving threat landscape.

Key Features:

*   **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography:** Implements Kyber768 for key encapsulation and Dilithium2 for digital signatures, providing robust protection against quantum attacks. These algorithms have been selected for their maturity and strong security properties based on NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization process.

*   **Secure Key Storage:** Employs authenticated encryption with AES-256-GCM to protect keys at rest. The encryption key used for storage is derived from a master key using a key derivation function (KDF) based on Argon2id, providing resistance to brute-force and dictionary attacks.

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Enforces granular access control policies based on user roles. Each role is assigned specific permissions for key management operations, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive cryptographic keys. This utilizes a custom authorization module written in Rust leveraging a policy definition language based on YAML for ease of configuration and auditability.

*   **Key Rotation:** Supports automated key rotation with configurable schedules. Old keys are securely archived and can be recovered for auditing purposes. The rotation process includes key generation, encryption, and distribution using secure channels.

*   **Audit Logging:** Maintains a comprehensive audit trail of all key management operations, including key generation, storage, access, and rotation. Audit logs are digitally signed to ensure their integrity and prevent tampering. Logs are stored locally and can be configured to be sent to a central logging server.

*   **Secure API:** Provides a well-defined API for integrating key management functionalities into existing applications. The API supports various operations, including key generation, encryption, decryption, signing, and verification. All API calls are authenticated and authorized to prevent unauthorized access.

*   **Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration:** Designed to be compatible with HSMs for enhanced key protection. Supports integration with PKCS#11 compatible HSMs allowing for secure key storage and cryptographic operations performed within a tamper-proof hardware environment.

Technology Stack:

*   **Rust:** The primary programming language, chosen for its memory safety, performance, and concurrency features. Rust ensures the security and reliability of the core key management functionalities.
*   **Kyber768:** A post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) used for establishing secure communication channels, resistant to quantum attacks.
*   **Dilithium2:** A post-quantum digital signature scheme used for verifying the authenticity and integrity of data, providing quantum-resistant signatures.
*   **AES-256-GCM:** Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode, used for authenticated encryption of keys at rest. Provides confidentiality and integrity protection.
*   **Argon2id:** A password hashing function used as a key derivation function (KDF) to derive encryption keys from a master key. Provides resistance to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
*   **YAML:** Used to define role-based access control policies for ease of configuration and auditability.

Installation:

1.  Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can download and install them from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2.  Clone the QuantumVault repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/QuantumVault

3.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd QuantumVault

4.  Build the project using Cargo:
    cargo build --release

5.  The compiled executable will be located in the `target/release` directory.

Configuration:

QuantumVault can be configured using environment variables and a configuration file.

*   **QUANTUMVAULT_MASTER_KEY:** The master key used for encrypting keys at rest. It is crucial to keep this key secure. If not provided, a random key will be generated on startup.

*   **QUANTUMVAULT_CONFIG_FILE:** The path to the configuration file, which defines role-based access control policies and other settings. Default location: `config.yaml`.

Example `config.yaml`:

rbac:
  admin:
    permissions:
      - key_generate
      - key_store
      - key_access
      - key_rotate
  user:
    permissions:
      - key_access

Usage:

To run QuantumVault, execute the compiled binary with the necessary environment variables set:

QUANTUMVAULT_MASTER_KEY="your_secure_master_key" ./target/release/quantumvault

The QuantumVault API provides the following endpoints:

*   `/key/generate`: Generates a new key pair. Requires `key_generate` permission.
*   `/key/store`: Stores a key. Requires `key_store` permission.
*   `/key/access/{key_id}`: Accesses a key. Requires `key_access` permission.
*   `/key/rotate/{key_id}`: Rotates a key. Requires `key_rotate` permission.

Example usage with `curl`:

# Generate a new key pair
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/key/generate -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>"

# Store a key
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/key/store -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" -d '{"key": "your_key_data"}'

# Access a key
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/key/access/123 -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>"
